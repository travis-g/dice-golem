Dice Golem is a dice roller bot for Discord! It rolls common RPG and TRPG dice expressions, like `2d6+1`, with support for modifiers like drop/keep, re-roll, and more.

## Features

Among other features:

- **Slash commands!** Type `/` and see all the supported commands.
- **Private rolls**: Make rolls in private by directly messaging Dice Golem or have roll results sent to you as DMs from the comfort of your server.
- **Secret rolls!** Make ethereal rolls that only you will see, wherever you are, and that self-delete without a trace.
- **Dice buttons**: use native mobile-friendly buttons to roll dice with a click or tap.

More features to come! You can follow what's being worked on and help test out beta features by joining the [support server][support-invite].
